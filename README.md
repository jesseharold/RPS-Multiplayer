A game of Rock, Paper, Scissors that you can play over the network with another player

For homework, week 7, UCLA coding boot camp

currently, no data persistence, both players must be on the same page

TODO: 
 - get full homework requirements
 - change local storage to cookie / add network access
 - hide the other player's move and score
 - add chat
 - add style, hand images, rotate hands, let player choose color (css transforms)
 - (optional) integrate network with your SET game!
